# Interactive Boxes Project

This is a small front-end project I made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The task was to create three interactive boxes that expand when clicked and show options for size and color.  
I tried to keep the design clean and close to the given Figma reference while focusing on the main functionality.
